\section*{Introduction}
The purpose of this assignment was to further understanding of data structures and implementations that were discussed in class.  Specifically, the project explored implementing a map ADT using a binary tree.  The performance of the operations of the map were analayzed for both a normal binary tree implementation and an AVL binary tree implementation.
